> [!WARNING]
> Although cutler is solid enough for daily-driving now, expect breaking changes before the v1 release.

## Overview

cutler aims to simplify your macOS setup experience into an "almost" one-command procedure. Define your settings once, then easily apply, track, and revert changes across your systemâ€”think of it as infrastructure-as-code for your Mac.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is still under development. If you like it, consider starring! It's free, and it always supports me to make such projects.
