## 🍺 Installation

Install cutler using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by simply running:

```bash
brew install hitblast/tap/cutler
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The prebuilt binaries are compiled and shipped from macOS 14 on arm64.
> Intel Macs will require a manual compilation of the project.

## Overview

If you use macOS, you might be familiar with changing settings using the
built-in System Settings app or the `defaults` command in the terminal. Both
methods can be tedious—and the terminal option usually involves manual tweaks.
That’s where `cutler` makes things simpler!

`cutler` is a straightforward command-line tool that lets you specify your macOS
preferences in an easy-to-read TOML file. It wraps the `defaults` command so you
can quickly apply or undo settings when needed.

Check out the [Usage](#usage) section for more details.

## Installation Methods

Besides using Homebrew as shown above, you can install the project in a couple of other ways:

- Using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install cutler
```

- Using `mise`:

```bash
# NOTE: This will compile the binary manually for your system.
mise use -g cargo:cutler
```

> [!TIP]
> If none of these installation methods work for you, try checking out the latest GitHub release.
> You can also use the periodic release workflows, which have a retention period of 90 days.

## Usage

`cutler` looks for your configuration in a file named `config.toml`, which can be located in one of these spots:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cutler/config.toml` or,
- `~/.config/cutler/config.toml`

It respects your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` setting, so you don't have to worry about
path issues. Just place your `config.toml` file in one of these locations and
you're set.

Here’s a basic example of a TOML configuration:

```toml
[dock]
tilesize = 46

[menuextra.clock]
FlashDateSeparators = true
```

For more details on the different `defaults` domains and available values on
macOS, take a look at the [Resources](#resources) section. The TOML above
translates into these commands:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock "tilesize" -int "46"
defaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock "FlashDateSeparators"
```

You can also configure settings for `NSGlobalDomain` like this:

```toml
[NSGlobalDomain]
ApplePressAndHoldEnabled = true

[NSGlobalDomain.com.apple.mouse]
linear = true
```

`cutler` converts the above TOML into:

```bash
defaults write NSGlobalDomain "ApplePressAndHoldEnabled" -bool true
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.linear -bool true
```

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, `cutler` does not verify the integrity of domains or keys under `NSGlobalDomain`. Please review these settings manually before applying any changes.

If you run `cutler apply` for the first time without an existing configuration
file, it will generate a sample config for you. You can also check out the
complete example in
[examples/cutler.toml](https://github.com/hitblast/cutler/blob/main/examples/cutler.toml).

Once your configuration file is ready, apply your settings by running:

```bash
cutler apply
```

> [!NOTE]
> After `cutler` updates the defaults, it restarts the necessary system services on your Mac so that the changes take effect. Some services might even require a full reboot to fully apply the new settings.

Sometimes you may want to check that your settings have been correctly
applied—or if they have been changed. To do that, run:

```bash
cutler status
```

To revert all modifications, run:

```bash
cutler unapply
```

Now, when it comes to managing the configuration file itself, there is a `config` command which has two other subcommands:

```bash
# Shows the contents of the configuration file.
cutler config show

# Unapplies and deletes the configuration file.
cutler config delete
```

You can add `--verbose` for more detail on what happens behind the scenes. For
additional information about all available commands, run:

```bash
cutler help
```

## Notable Things

When you run `cutler apply`, a snapshot file named `.cutler_snapshot` is created
in your home directory. This file records your configuration state and lets you
revert to a previous setup if needed. It’s important not to overwrite or delete
this file manually, as it is essential for maintaining the integrity of your
configuration.

Finding the ideal set of macOS defaults can be challenging. Visit the [macOS
defaults website](https://macos-defaults.com/) for a comprehensive list of
available settings.
