## Overview

cutler aims to simplify your macOS setup experience into an "almost" one-command procedure. Define your settings once, then easily apply, track, and revert changes across your system—think of it as infrastructure-as-code for your Mac.

This project is still under development, and more ways of improving it are constantly popping up. If you like it, consider starring! It's free, and it always supports me to make such projects.

## Installation

You can install cutler by running this command in the terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cutlercli.github.io/scripts/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

See ["Installation"](https://cutlercli.github.io/cookbook/installation.html) for other methods.
