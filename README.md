## Overview

Most of us, who use macOS, either configure it using the built-in System Settings app, or the `defaults` command-line tool.
Both of these options are tedious and the latter requires manual tinkering with the settings inside a terminal. `cutler` is a
project which solves just that!

It is a simple command-line interface which you can use to store your macOS system preferences by declaring them inside a
TOML file. It wraps around the existing `defaults` command and gives you an easy-to-use way of applying and unapplying
settings/values on the go.

See the [Usage](#usage) section to learn more.

## Installation Methods

Aside of Homebrew (given at the top of page), you can use either the `cargo`
package manager or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) for installating cutler.

- Using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install cutler
```

- Using `mise`:

```bash
mise use -g cargo
```

> [!TIP]
> If you still can't find a suitable installation method, consider looking at the latest GitHub release.
> Or, consider the periodic release workflows which have a 90-day retention period.

## Usage

The interface reads your set configuration values from a `config.toml` file,
which can be located inside these directories:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cutler/config.toml` or,
- `~/.config/cutler/config.toml`

Moreover, `cutler` respects the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable so you don't have to
worry about it messing up any paths indefinitely. Just place the `config.toml`
file in these locations and the interface will find it.

The structure of the file should be as follows:

```toml
# Example configuration can be generated by running:
# `cutler apply` (for the first time)

[dock]
tilesize = 46

[menuextra.clock]
FlashDateSeparators = true
```

Here, the TOML code translates to the following commands being executed:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock "tilesize" -int "46"
defaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock "FlashDateSeparators"
```

Once you finish writing the file, apply the written configurations using this command:

```bash
cutler apply
```

Now, to unapply the configuration, run:

```bash
cutler unapply
```

If you'd like to remove the file entirely, you can run the following command:
(generally not recommended since currently applied settings could become untrackable)

```bash
cutler delete
```

## Contributing

This is one of my hobby projects that I've made to solve one of my most common
problems - repeatedly applying the same settings on my MacBook. So, pull
requests are always welcome! Feel free to submit your changes or improvements by
