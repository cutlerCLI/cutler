## Overview

cutler aims to simplify your macOS setup experience into an "almost" one-command procedure. Define your settings once, then easily apply, track, and revert changes across your system—think of it as infrastructure-as-code for your Mac.

## Installation

You can install cutler by running this command in the terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cutlercli.github.io/scripts/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

See ["Installation"](https://cutlercli.github.io/cookbook/installation.html) for other methods.

> [!WARNING]
> **DEPRECATION:** The x86_64 builds will soon be removed in favor of Apple Silicon, as Apple themselves have officially discontinued this timed architecture.
