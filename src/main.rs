/* The Heart *sparkles*
 *
 * Some personal take:
 *
 * I've tried incorporating a very minimal main.rs since most developers often try to fill their projects' main.rs up
 * with unnecessary boilerplate. cutler has been my primary way of learning and practicing Rust through a real-world
 * project which I actually use on a daily basis in my workflow, and honestly it has made me a better programmer to
 * say the least.
 *
 * However, I do not like people who flood crates.io with unnecessary iterations of their own garbage, so let's spread
 * good code and let's spread "meaningful" code.
 *
 * I don't know how well I've even managed to write cutler (as any amount of code is a liability anyway), but hopefully
 * if you're looking at this and you've cloned the project onto your computer, you'll have a look around, and maybe
 * produce a lot of good code, which could potentially be beneficial to both you and the community.
 *
 * I relicensed this code from MIT to GPL only from the sheer inspiration of writing "good" code (taken from other
 * projects such as git), so I suppose let's keep that going ^w^ happy coding!
