# Contributing

This is a hobby project of mine which has slowly started to scale up to a full-time side project. You can always help out with new ideas or features by [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) or [submitting an issue](https://github.com/hitblast/cutler/issues)!

If you, as a developer, would like to dive into the nitty-gritty of contributing to cutler, view the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). I'm still writing it as the project progresses.

Pull requests and issues must have the following pattern:

```
(<type>) <title>
```

Possible types include:

- feat: New feature or enhancement
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation update
- style: Code style or formatting change
- refactor: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- test: Test-related changes
- chore: Maintenance or administrative tasks
