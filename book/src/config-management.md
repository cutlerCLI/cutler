# Configuration Management

Sometimes it might be handy to have a look at your current config file without having to open it. In such an event, run:

```bash
$ cutler config show
```

This will show all the bare-bones values that you have written. You can also delete the file if necessary:

```bash
$ cutler config delete
```
