</div>

## Backstory

Some of us really have a craze for configs and ricing. Though, looking at the dotfiles of others, I have realized that although they have really efficient scripts, they are not always easy to maintain and/or understand for others. I, personally, sometimes used to have a hard time navigating others' configurations.

And while, I might not be able to solve it for everyone, I have been using macOS for the past 4 years. Using it has given me a pretty good grip on the ecosystem and how preferences are handled.

## Why?

While using macOS, I have come to realize that most solutions like [Nix](https://nixos.org/) are not always easy to maintain either. So, I wanted to create a tool that abstracts away all the complexity into simple, already-known terms for most power users.

And that's how <code>cutler</code> came to be.

## What this book does

This book, by name, wants to introduce you with <code>cutler</code>, a software made to declaratively manage your macOS preferences and essentials. It can do a number of things. This book will help you navigate all of them, including new ones which are currently in development.

It's a solo project, but I hope it will give you the proper impression for shrinking dotfiles by an order of magnitude.
