## Overview

cutler aims to simplify your macOS setup experience into an "almost" one-command procedure. Define your settings once, then easily apply, track, and revert changes across your systemâ€”think of it as infrastructure-as-code for your Mac.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still under development. So, if you like it, consider starring! It's free, and it always supports me to make such projects.

## Key Features

- Manage your Mac's system preferences with just one TOML file.
- Track your Homebrew formulae/casks and back them up to restore later.
- Run external commands, both as hooks, or at your will.
- Revert back modifications easily with the snapshot mechanism.
- Do all of these things at an incredibly fast speed, thanks to Rust.
