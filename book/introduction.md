# Introduction

**cutler** is a powerful, declarative settings manager for your Mac, designed for speed and simplicity.

cutler aims to simplify your macOS setup experience into an "almost" one-command procedure. Define your settings once, then easily apply, track, and revert changes across your systemâ€”think of it as infrastructure-as-code for your Mac.

> **Note:** This project is still under development. If you like it, consider starring the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hitblast/cutler)! Your support helps drive further improvements.

## What is cutler?

cutler lets you manage your Mac's system preferences, Homebrew packages, and custom setup commands using a single TOML configuration file. With cutler, you can:

- Apply and revert system settings declaratively.
- Track and restore Homebrew formulae and casks.
- Run external commands as part of your setup or teardown.
- Snapshot and restore your configuration state.
- Enjoy fast, reliable operations thanks to Rust.

Whether you're setting up a new Mac, sharing your configuration with others, or just want to keep your environment reproducible, cutler makes it easy.
